# Cucumber BDD Tests Implementation

This document provides an overview of the implementation of Cucumber BDD tests for the Math Study project.

## Current Implementation

### Directory Structure

- `features/`: Contains the feature files written in Gherkin syntax
  - `math-game.feature`: Describes the math game scenarios
- `features/step_definitions/`: Contains the step definition files
  - `math-game.steps.ts`: Implements the steps for math game scenarios
- `features/support/`: Contains support files
  - `world.ts`: Defines the custom world for sharing context between steps
  - `setup.ts`: Sets up the testing environment

### Configuration

- `cucumber.js`: Configures Cucumber to run the tests
- `package.json`: Contains scripts to run the tests

### Testing Approach

The current implementation uses a mock-based approach for testing. Instead of directly rendering React components, which can be challenging in a Cucumber test environment, we use mock functions to simulate the behavior of the components.

This approach allows us to test the behavior of the application without dealing with the complexities of rendering React components in a non-browser environment.

## Running the Tests

To run the Cucumber tests, use one of the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Run tests with default formatter
npm run test:cucumber

# Run tests with pretty formatter for better readability
npm run test:cucumber:pretty
```

## Future Improvements

### Integration with React Testing Library

The current implementation uses mock functions to simulate the behavior of React components. In the future, we could integrate more closely with React Testing Library to render actual components in the tests.

This would require:
1. Setting up a proper JSDOM environment for Cucumber tests
2. Configuring the tests to handle React's asynchronous rendering
3. Updating the step definitions to use the real React Testing Library functions

### Implementing Missing Features

The current implementation includes tests for features that don't exist yet in the application, such as the dropdown for selecting game modes. As these features are implemented, the tests should be updated to use the actual implementation instead of mocks.

### Adding More Scenarios

The current implementation covers the basic scenarios for the math game. In the future, we could add more scenarios to test edge cases and additional features.

## Notes for Developers

### Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:
1. Add a new scenario to the appropriate feature file
2. Implement the step definitions in the appropriate step definition file
3. Run the tests to ensure they pass

### Updating Existing Tests

When updating existing tests:
1. Update the scenario in the feature file if necessary
2. Update the step definitions in the step definition file
3. Run the tests to ensure they pass

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the tests:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify that the step definitions match the steps in the feature file
3. Ensure that the mock functions are properly simulating the behavior of the components
